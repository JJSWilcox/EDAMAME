EDAMAME Intro Lecture (July 11, 2016)

Main Intro:
+Be fearless, and willing to try new things
+Code of Conduct (Be Cool)
+Help Each other; use our group expertise


Why are we hear?

Commuity:  Interact with each other and/or the environment

Incidental, dormant, dead?

Rare taxa?


___________________________________________
Tutorial Data set:
Centralia, PA (underground Coal Mind burning since 1962)

Surface temparature up to 80C
Will keep buring unti Coal runs out (100+ years)
Evolutionary processes?
Multigeneartion Recovery? (Succession? not mentioned specifically)
Community stability?


Data sampled chronologically along firefronts, hot and recovered.  Non-burned
areas included as well.

Experimental Design (Adina: July 11, 2016)


Representative Questions for Group:

Are their core eukaryotic components in gut of monkeys and are these influenced
by nutirent inputs?; How do lentic bacterialcommunity change with carbon input? 
Mercury methylation based on communities that mediate this: how do mircobes 
differ across redox gradients influence organic mercury formation? Cell-cell
signalling with dormant bacteria: how does RPF influence culturablity?


Structure:
Use Amplicon.  Relatively cost-effective if lareg number of pooled-samples.
Good reference databases.

Function:
Transciptomes
-Can enrich eukaryotic RNA with polyA tail (for transcriptomes)
-proteomics
-nutrients (bio-chemical analysis)
-Metagenomics

Positives:
-All genes

Negative:
-costs


HiSeq
1Tb $15-$20k

Base pairs: chance of seeing a gene, genome_size x (1/proportion of all genes)

Explorations in Data Analyses for Metagenomic Advances in Microbial Ecology
Workflow (Ashley: July 12, 2016)

Workflow:
Exactly what you tell the computer to execute the analysis
-verbatim scripts that were executed
-Annotated:
	-software versions used
	-Description of what the software is doing/goal of that step
	-Brief notes on deviations from default options

Analysis workflow:
1) Examine data (demultiplexed? Number of files? Format?)
2) Think about what you want to do with data?



1) Systemic Workflow
2)Seamless, and optimized.  No manual stps.
3) Implement reproducibility check-points.  Specific areas where you can find
the same results.

Naming Conventions:
Simple sample IDs that contain sample data

Subsample to run portions of dataset to troubleshoot and optimize workflow.
